## Background

I am an student from Chile of 18 years at this moment, I started programming at the age of 12 and from that moment I fell in love with the programming. The idea of this repository came to me when I saw a video of fireship called [~/.dotfiles in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_MpUP6aKiQ), then I started this project. First it was the dotfiles and the standard files that I normally use in a project but then I separed them in 2 projects, this and [newrepo](https://github.com/LuckJMG/newrepo).

## Install

To install and configure your new enviroment first you need to clone this repo in `~`:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/LuckJMG/.dotfiles.git
```

Then execute `install.sh` to install and configure everything else:

``` bash
./.dotfiles/install.sh
```

### Dependencies

Before installing the .dotfiles repo first you need to be in windows and install these things:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the [settings sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) extension)
- [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
- [wsl2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

## Thanks

I really appreciate that you have come this far, thank you very much, for me, a 17 years old student, that someone viewed his project is a very large achievement, and I hope that my code can be useful to you.
